Koala file system is a network disk used to store personal files. User-friendly clients can be obtained on various platforms. It is specially optimized for the storage and display of photos and videos.

## project goals

There are many network disk applications now, but I havenâ€™t found one that suits my needs. Currently Synology Photos is the closest to these goals.

I want it to be:

1. There are no storage size and traffic restrictions, which requires it to be open source and be able to be deployed on your own server
2. It can be accessed on various platforms, including web pages, desktops, mobile phones, command lines, and can also be mounted to local file systems.
3. There are some useful apps, such as photo albums, notes, etc.
4. Only one copy of duplicate files is saved to save storage space.
5. Sync automatically and quickly.
6. Able to synchronize the contents of other network disks.
7. Can use other network disks to store files to prevent file loss and damage.
